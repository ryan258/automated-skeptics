# Technical Architecture Decisions

## Overview

This document tracks major technical decisions made during the development of the Automated Skeptic MVP.

## Decision Log

### 2024-01-XX: Agent Architecture Pattern

**Decision**: Implement a linear pipeline of specialized agents rather than a complex swarm intelligence approach.

**Rationale**:

- Simplifies MVP development and debugging
- Easier to test individual components
- Clear separation of concerns
- Can evolve to more complex interactions in V2.0

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Fully parallel agent swarm
- Single monolithic processor
- Event-driven agent communication

### 2024-01-XX: Data Storage Strategy

**Decision**: Use SQLite for caching and local data storage.

**Rationale**:

- No external database dependencies
- Built into Python
- Sufficient for MVP scale
- Easy backup and portability

**Alternatives Considered**:

- PostgreSQL
- In-memory only storage
- File-based JSON storage

### 2024-01-XX: LLM Integration Approach

**Decision**: Use OpenAI API strategically for claim deconstruction, with fallback to rule-based processing.

**Rationale**:

- Leverages LLM strengths for complex parsing tasks
- Maintains functionality when API is unavailable
- Cost-effective for MVP scope
- Allows quality comparison between approaches

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Full LLM-based processing
- No LLM integration
- Local LLM deployment

### 2024-01-XX: API Integration Strategy

**Decision**: Sequential integration starting with Wikipedia, then adding NewsAPI and Google Search.

**Rationale**:

- Reduces complexity during development
- Allows testing of integration patterns
- Wikipedia provides reliable baseline
- Can optimize based on source performance

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Parallel implementation of all APIs
- Focus on single high-quality source
- Web scraping instead of APIs

### 2024-01-XX: Error Handling Philosophy

**Decision**: Graceful degradation with detailed logging rather than strict failure modes.

**Rationale**:

- Better user experience
- Easier debugging during development
- Allows partial results when some components fail
- Maintains audit trail for analysis

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Fail-fast approach
- Silent error recovery
- User-prompted error recovery

## Future Decision Points

### V2.0 Considerations

- Advanced source credibility assessment
- Multi-language support
- Real-time vs batch processing
- User interface development
- Deployment strategy (cloud vs local)

### Scalability Decisions Deferred

- Database migration strategy
- Caching optimization
- API rate limit management at scale
- Performance monitoring and alerting
