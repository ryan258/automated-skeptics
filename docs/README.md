## 🏗️ Architecture

### Agent Pipeline

The system implements a linear pipeline of specialized AI agents:

1. **🔔 Herald Agent (Input Processor)**

   - Text validation and cleaning
   - Input normalization
   - Basic content filtering

2. **💡 Illuminator Agent (Context Analyzer)**

   - Topic classification (historical, biographical, corporate, news)
   - Named entity recognition
   - Claim categorization

3. **🧠 Logician Agent (Claim Deconstructor)**

   - Breaks claims into verifiable sub-components
   - Entity extraction and relationship mapping
   - LLM-powered analysis with rule-based fallback

4. **🔍 Seeker Agent (Research Engine)**

   - Multi-source evidence gathering
   - Wikipedia, NewsAPI, Google Search integration
   - Source credibility assessment and ranking

5. **🔮 Oracle Agent (Evidence Synthesizer)**
   - Evidence aggregation and analysis
   - Verdict generation (SUPPORTED/CONTRADICTED/INSUFFICIENT)
   - Confidence scoring and explanation

### Technology Stack

- **Core**: Python 3.9+, spaCy, NLTK
- **APIs**: OpenAI GPT-3.5, Wikipedia, NewsAPI, Google Search
- **Storage**: SQLite (caching), JSON (results)
- **Testing**: pytest, comprehensive unit/integration tests

from pipeline.orchestrator import SkepticPipeline
from data.models import Claim
from config.settings import Settings

# Initialize pipeline
settings = Settings()
pipeline = SkepticPipeline(settings)

# Process claim
claim = Claim(text="Your claim to verify")
